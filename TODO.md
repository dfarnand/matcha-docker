- Test to make sure Matcha can run as expected
- Links should be on separate lines
- Favicons (in feed titles) probably need to be smaller
- The favicon for the page should be a cup of matcha
- Green on black is too harsh. terminal.xyz has better colors than that.
- Adapt repo to build docker container on github (compose will just be an example of how to run it at home with precompiled image)
